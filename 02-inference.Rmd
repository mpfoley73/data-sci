# Discrete Analysis

For categorical data you typically assume the data have been generated from a Poisson, binomial or multinomial distribution. Statistical analysis depends on the data generation mechanism, although in some situations, depending on the objective, we may ignore that mechanism and simplify our analysis.
The following sampling methods correspond to the distributions considered
Unrestricted sampling (corresponds to Poisson distribution)
Sampling with fixed total sample size (corresponds to Binomial or Multinomial distributions)
