# Appendix {-}

Here are miscellaneous skills, knowledge, and technologies I should know.

## Publishing to BookDown {-}

The **bookdown** package, written by Yihui Xie, is built on top of R Markdown and the **knitr** package.  Use it to publish a book or long manuscript where each chapter is a separate file.  There are instructions for how to author a book in his [bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) [@xie2019].  The main advantage of **bookdown** over R Markdown is that you can produce multi-page HTML output with numbered headers, equations, figures, etc., just like in a book.  I'm using **bookdown** to create a compendium of all my data science notes.  

The first step to using **bookdown** is installing the **bookdown* package with `install.packages("bookdown")`.

Next, create an account at [bookdown.org](http://bookdown.org), and connect the account to RStudio.  Follow the instructions at [https://bookdown.org/home/about/](https://bookdown.org/home/about/).

Finally, create a project in R Studio by creating a new project of type *Book Project using Bookdown*.

After creating all of your Markdown pages, knit the book or click the **Build Book** button in the Build panel.

## Packages {-}

**R Packages** [@Wickham2015] by Hadley Wickham is a good manual on packages, but it does not include a full tutorial.  The [Developing R Packages](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/developing-r-packages/) Data Camp course is also helpful.  I will set up my own exercise and present it here.  I will create a package for my pretend organization, "MF".  The package will include the following:

* R Markdown template.  My template will integrate code, output, and commentary in a single R Markdown. The template will produce a familiar work product containing standard content (summary, data management, exploratory analysis, methods, results, conclusions), and a standard style (colors, typeface, size, logo).

* Functions.  Common I/O functions for database retrieval, writing to Excel.  Common graphing functions for ggplot styling.

I am mostly copying the logic and code from the ggthemes [economist.R](https://rdrr.io/cran/ggthemes/src/R/economist.R) script.


### Create a package {-}

1. In the RStudio IDE, click File > New Project.  Select "New Directory".  Select "R Package".  You can also use `devtools::create("mfstylr")`.  This will create the minimum items for an R package.

![](./images/create_pkg.png)

    + R directory: R scripts with function definitions.
    + man directory: documentation
    + NAMESPACE file: information about imported functions and functions made available (managed by **roxygen2**)
    + DESCRIPTION file: metadata about the package
  
2. Write functions in R scripts in R directory.  Document with tags readable by *roxygen2* package.
3. Select XYZ > Install and Restart.

### Create Data {-}

Add an RData file to your package with `use_data()`

### Create Vignette {-}

Add a directory and template vignette with `use_vignette(name, title)`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
use_vignette("Creating-Plots-with-mfstylr", "Creating Plots with mfstylr")
```


#### Step 2: Create an R Markdown template {-}

I relied on [this blog](http://freerangestats.info/blog/2017/09/09/rmarkdown) at *free range statistics* for a lot what follows.  There is also good information about R Markdown and templates in Yihui Xie's **R Markdown: The Definitive Guide** [@Xie2019b].  

Use `use_this::use_rmarkdown_template()` to create an Rmd template.  I will create a "Kaggle Report" template.  In the Console (or a script), enter

```{r eval=FALSE}
use_rmarkdown_template(
  template_name = "Kaggle Report",
  template_dir = "kaggle_report",
  template_description = "Template for creating Kaggle reports in RMarkdown.",
  template_create_dir = FALSE
)
```

Since my project directory is `C:\Users\mpfol\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\mfstylr`, `use_rmarkdown_template()` creates subdirectories `.\inst\rmarkdown\templates\kaggle_report\skeleton` with three files

* `.\inst\rmarkdown\templates\kaggle_report\template.yaml`
* `.\inst\rmarkdown\templates\kaggle_report\skeleton\skeleton.Rmd`

My kaggle report template will include a logo.  Looks like there are two ways to embed an image in your document.  One is a direct image loading reference `!()`, but I don't think you can control the attributes this way.  A second way is adding html tags.

```{r eval=FALSE}
![](logo.png)

# or for more control
<img src="logo.png" style="position:absolute;top:0px;right:0px;" />
```
