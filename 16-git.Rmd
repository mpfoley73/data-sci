Unlike other version control systems that manage file changes, Git works as a managed system of file snapshots. 

Git files reside in three main states: modified, staged, and committed. Modified files have changed but have not committed into the database yet. Staged files are marked in their current version to go into the next commit snapshot. Committed files are safely stored in the local database.

This leads to the three main sections of a Git project: the working tree, the staging area, and the Git directory. The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify. The staging area (index) is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.

The basic Git workflow goes like this:

1. Modify files in the working tree.

2. Selectively stage just the changes you want to include in the next commit.

3. Commit the files from the staging area into the Git directory.

Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win. After installing, set your user name and email address. Every Git commit uses this information.

```
$ git config --global user.name "Michael Foley"
$ git config --global user.email mike@hotmail.com
```

Show your configuration settings and version with 

```
$ git config --list
$ git --version
```

## Getting a Git Repository

Create a git repository either by cloning and existing one, or converting a directory into one. Start by navigating to your GitHub parent directory.

```
$ pwd
$ cd ~/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/
```

To clone an existing repository, specify its url.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mpfoley73/data-sci
```

To convert a directory, navigate to its folder, initialize it, add files, and commit.

```
$ cd data-sci/
$ ls
$ git init

$ git add *.Rmd
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m 'Initial project version'
```

When you first clone a repository, all of your files are tracked and unmodified. As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because youâ€™ve changed them since your last commit. As you work, selectively stage the modified files, then finally commit the staged changes. To see what status your files are in, use `git status`.

```
git status
```

As you work, you may add, edit, and delete files. When you reach a milestone, add the files to a Staging Environment. Staged files are ready to be committed to the repository. 

:::rmdnote
In GitHub, you stage a file by committing it to your branch.
:::

> git status
> git add [<filename>, --all]

Once the file(s) are staged, you can commit them to the branch. 

> commit -m "Added new files."

You can commit all files without staging with -a

> commit -a -m "Added new files."
