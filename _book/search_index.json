Use it to publish a book or long manuscript where each chapter is a separate file. There are instructions for how to author a book in his bookdown book (Xie 2019). The main advantage of bookdown over R Markdown is that you can produce multi-page HTML output with numbered headers, equations, figures, etc., just like in a book. I’m using bookdown to create a compendium of all my data science notes. The first step to using bookdown is installing the **bookdown* package with install.packages(\"bookdown\"). Next, create an account at bookdown.org, and connect the account to RStudio. Follow the instructions at https://bookdown.org/home/about/. Finally, create a project in R Studio by creating a new project of type Book Project using Bookdown. After creating all of your Markdown pages, knit the book or click the Build Book button in the Build panel. References "],
