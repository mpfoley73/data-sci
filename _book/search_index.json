You usually construct a one-way table to test whether the frequency counts differ from a hypothesized distribution using the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test. Here is an example. A researcher crosses tall cut-leaf tomatoes with dwarf potato-leaf tomatoes, then classifies the (\\(n = 1,611\\)) offspring phenotypes. o &lt;- c(926, 288, 293, 104) cell_names &lt;- c(&quot;tall cut-leaf&quot;, &quot;tall potato-leaf&quot;, &quot;dwarf cut-leaf&quot;, &quot;dwarf potato-leaf&quot;) names(o) &lt;- cell_names print(o) ## tall cut-leaf tall potato-leaf dwarf cut-leaf dwarf potato-leaf ## 926 288 293 104 The four phenotypes are expected to occur with relative frequencies 9:3:3:1. pi &lt;- c(9, 3, 3, 1) / (9 + 3 + 3 + 1) print(pi) ## [1] 0.5625 0.1875 0.1875 0.0625 Do the observed phonotype counts conform to the expected proportions? 4.1.1 Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit Test The chi-squared goodness-of-fit test tests whether observed frequency counts \\(O_j\\) of the \\(j \\in (0, 1, \\cdots k)\\) levels of a categorical variable differ from expected frequency counts \\(E_j\\). \\(H_0\\) is \\(O_j = E_j\\). There are two test statistics for this test, Pearson \\(X^2\\) and deviance \\(G^2\\). The sampling distribution of each test statistic approach the chi-squared distribution as \\(n\\) becomes large. It’s a good idea to calculate both test statistics. The Pearson goodness-of-fit statistic is \\[X^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_j - E_j)^2}{E_j}\\] where \\(O_j = p_j n\\) and \\(E_j = \\pi_j n\\). The deviance statistic is \\[G^2 = 2 \\sum O_j \\log \\left( \\frac{O_j}{E_j} \\right)\\] If the saturated model (the observed data represent the fit of the saturated model, the most complex model possible with the data) proportions \\(p_j\\) equal equal the expected proportions \\(\\pi_j\\), \\(X^2\\) and \\(G^2\\) will equal zero. Large values indicate the data do not agree well with the proposed model. As \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\(G^2\\) and \\(X^2\\) approach \\(\\chi_{k-1}^2\\) where \\(k\\) is the number of n-way table cells. You can therefore run a chi-square test of significance using the \\(G^2\\) and \\(X^2\\) test statistics.

["two-way-tables.html", "4.2 Two-Way Tables", " 4.2 Two-Way Tables These notes rely on PSU STATS 504 course notes. A two-way frequency table is a frequency table for two categorical variables. You usually construct a two-way table to test whether the frequency counts in one categorical variable differ from the other categorical variable using the chi-squared test of independence. If there is a significant difference, then you characterize the effect sizes with measures of association (difference in proportions, relative risk, or odds ratio). Here is an example. A double blind study investigated the therapeutic value of vitamin C \\((trt \\in [Placebo, VitaminC])\\) for treating common colds \\((result \\in [Cold, No Cold])\\) on a sample of \\(n = 279\\) persons.

(The independence model is a subset of the saturated model where the two explanatory variables are independent.) 4.2.1 Chi-Squared Test of Independence The chi-squared test for independence tests whether observed joint frequency counts \\(O_{ij}\\) of the \\(i \\in (0, 1, \\cdots I)\\) levels of categorical variable \\(Y\\) and the \\(j \\in (0, 1, \\cdots J)\\) levels of categorical variable \\(Z\\) differ from expected frequency counts \\(E_{ij}\\) under the independence model where \\(P(Y \\cap Z) = P(Y)P(Z)\\) \\((\\pi_{ij} = \\pi_{i+} \\pi_{+j})\\). \\(H_0\\) is \\(O_{ij} = E_{ij}\\). The independence model is the joint probabilities of independent variables, . There are two test statistics for this test, Pearson \\(X^2\\) and deviance \\(G^2\\). The sampling distribution of each test statistic approach the chi-squared distribution as \\(n\\) becomes large. It’s a good idea to calculate both test statistics. The Pearson goodness-of-fit statistic is \\[X^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_j - E_j)^2}{E_j}\\] where \\(O_j = p_j n\\) and \\(E_j = \\pi_j n\\). The deviance statistic is \\[G^2 = 2 \\sum O_j \\log \\left( \\frac{O_j}{E_j} \\right)\\] If the saturated model (the observed data represent the fit of the saturated model, the most complex model possible with the data) proportions \\(p_j\\) equal equal the expected proportions \\(\\pi_j\\), \\(X^2\\) and \\(G^2\\) will equal zero. Large values indicate the data do not agree well with the proposed model. As \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\(G^2\\) and \\(X^2\\) approach \\(\\chi_{k-1}^2\\) where \\(k\\) is the number of n-way table cells. You can therefore run a chi-square test of significance using the \\(G^2\\) and \\(X^2\\) test statistics. The chi-square test provides reliable results when at least 80% of \\(E_j &gt;= 5\\). The chi-squared test for independence tests whether there is a significant relationship between two categorical variables. The null hypothesis is no relationship. The Pearson goodness-of-fit statistic is \\[X^2 = \\sum_{i,j} \\frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}\\] where for independent variables \\(E_{ij}\\) equals the marginal probability of row \\(i\\) multiplied by the marginal probability of column \\(j\\).

In social sciences and epidemiology \\(\\pi_{1|1}\\) and \\(\\pi_{1|2}\\) are sometimes referred to as “risk” values. The point estimate for \\(\\delta\\) is \\(d = p_{1|1} - p_{1|2}\\). Under the normal approximation method, the sampling distribution of the difference in population proportions has a normal distribution centered at \\(d\\) with variance \\(Var(\\delta)\\). The point estimate for \\(Var(\\delta)\\) is \\(Var(d)\\). \\[Var(d) = \\frac{p_{1|1} (1 - p_{1|1})}{n_{1+}} + \\frac{p_{1|2} (1 - p_{1|2})}{n_{2+}}\\] In the vitamin C acid example, \\(\\delta\\) is the difference in the row conditional frequencies. p &lt;- prop.table(vitc_dat, margin = 1) d &lt;- p[2, 1] - p[1, 1] print(d) ## [1] -0.09912641 The variance is var_d &lt;- (p[2, 1])*(1 - p[2, 1]) / sum(vitc_dat[2, ]) + (p[1, 1])*(1 - p[1, 1]) / sum(vitc_dat[1, ]) The 95% CI is d + c(-1, 1) * qnorm(.975) * sqrt(var_d) ## [1] -0.18685917 -0.01139366 This is how prop.test() without the continuity correction calculates the confidence interval.

That’s what prop.test() is doing. The square of the z-statistic is algebraically equal to \\(\\chi^2\\). The two-sided test comparing \\(Z\\) to a \\(N(0, 1)\\) is identical to comparing \\(\\chi^2\\) to a chi-squared distribution with df =1. Compare the \\(Z^2\\) to the output from prop.test(). z^2 ## [1] 4.811413 Even though difference of two proportions is very easy to interpret, one problem with using δ is that when Z = 1 is a rare event, the individual probabilities P(Z = 1 | Y = 1) and P(Z = 1 | Y = 2) are both small, i.e., close to zero. Absolute value of δ will be close to zero even when the effect is strong. In the following sections we study two other common measures of association which compare the relative value of the proportions, rather than the absolute values. One problem with evaluating \\(\\delta\\) is that when \\(Z = 1\\) is a rare event, the individual probabilities \\(\\pi_{1|1}\\) and \\(\\pi_{1|2}\\) are both close to zero, and so \\(\\delta\\) is also close to zero even when the effect is strong.
