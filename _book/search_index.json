The chi-square goodness-of-fit test, tests whether observed frequency counts \\(O_j\\) of the \\(j \\in (0, 1, \\cdots k)\\) levels of a categorical variable differ from expected frequency counts \\(E_j\\). \\(H_0\\) is \\(O_j = E_j\\). There are two test statistics for this test, Pearson \\(X^2\\) and deviance \\(G^2\\). The sampling distribution of each test statistic approach the chi-squared distribution as \\(n\\) becomes large. It’s a good idea to calculate both test statistics. The Pearson goodness-of-fit statistic is \\[X^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_j - E_j)^2}{E_j}\\] where \\(O_j = p_j n\\) and \\(E_j = \\pi_j n\\). The deviance statistic is \\[G^2 = 2 \\sum O_j \\log \\left( \\frac{O_j}{E_j} \\right)\\] If the saturated model (the observed data represent the fit of the saturated model, the most complex model possible with the data) proportions \\(p_j\\) equal equal the expected proportions \\(\\pi_j\\), \\(X^2\\) and \\(G^2\\) will equal zero. Large values indicate the data do not agree well with the proposed model. As \\(n \\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\(G^2\\) and \\(X^2\\) approach \\(\\chi_{k-1}^2\\) where \\(k\\) is the number of n-way table cells. You can therefore run a chi-square test of significance using the \\(G^2\\) and \\(X^2\\) test statistics. The chi-square test provides reliable results when at least 80% of \\(E_j &gt;= 5\\). 4.1.1 One-Way Tables A one-way frequency table is a frequency table for a single categorical table. Here is a simple chi-square test example. A researcher crosses tall cut-leaf tomatoes with dwarf potato-leaf tomatoes, then classifies the (\\(n = 1,611\\)) offspring phenotypes. o &lt;- c(926, 288, 293, 104) cell_names &lt;- c(&quot;tall cut-leaf&quot;, &quot;tall potato-leaf&quot;, &quot;dwarf cut-leaf&quot;, &quot;dwarf potato-leaf&quot;) names(o) &lt;- cell_names print(o) ## tall cut-leaf tall potato-leaf dwarf cut-leaf dwarf potato-leaf ## 926 288 293 104 The four phenotypes are expected to occur with relative frequencies 9:3:3:1. pi &lt;- c(9, 3, 3, 1) / (9 + 3 + 3 + 1) e &lt;- sum(o) * pi names(e) &lt;- cell_names print(e) ## tall cut-leaf tall potato-leaf dwarf cut-leaf dwarf potato-leaf ## 906.1875 302.0625 302.0625 100.6875 data.frame(o, e) %&gt;% rownames_to_column() %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = -rowname) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(rowname), y = value, fill = name)) + geom_col(position = position_dodge()) + geom_text(aes(label = round(value, 0)), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) + theme_mf() + scale_fill_mf() + labs(title = &quot;Observed vs Expected&quot;, fill = &quot;&quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;) The \\(X^2\\) statistic is x2 &lt;- sum((o - e)^2 / e) = 1.468722 and the \\(G^2\\) statistic is g2 &lt;- 2 * sum(o * log(o / e)) = 1.4775868, so nearly identical. The chi-sq test p-values are also nearly identical. pchisq(q = x2, df = length(o) - 1, lower.tail = FALSE) ## [1] 0.6895079 pchisq(q = g2, df = length(o) - 1, lower.tail = FALSE) ## [1] 0.6874529 The p-values based on the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with 3 d.f. are about 0.69, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis - the data are consistent with the genetic theory. The \\(\\chi^2\\) value is well outside the \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) level range of regression. alpha &lt;- 0.05 dof &lt;- length(e) - 1 lrr = -Inf p_val &lt;- pchisq(q = x2, df = length(o) - 1, lower.tail = FALSE) urr = qchisq(p = alpha, df = dof, lower.tail = FALSE) data.frame(chi2 = seq(from = 0, to = 20, by = .1)) %&gt;% mutate(density = dchisq(x = chi2, df = dof)) %&gt;% mutate(rr = ifelse(chi2 &lt; lrr | chi2 &gt; urr, density, 0)) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x = chi2, y = density), color = mf_pal(12)(12)[12], size = 0.8) + geom_area(aes(x = chi2, y = rr), fill = mf_pal(12)(12)[2], alpha = 0.8) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = x2), color = mf_pal(12)(12)[11], size = 0.8) + labs(title = bquote(&quot;Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit Test&quot;), subtitle = paste0(&quot;Chisq=&quot;, round(x2,2), &quot;, &quot;, &quot;Critical value=&quot;, round(urr,2), &quot;, &quot;, &quot;p-value=&quot;, round(p_val,3), &quot;.&quot; ), x = &quot;chisq&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + theme_mf() Inspect the residuals to learn which differences may lead to rejecting the null hypothesis. The Pearson and deviance statistics are sums of individual cell comparisons which can be termed the squared “residuals”, \\(X^2 = \\sum r_j^2\\) and \\(G^2 = \\sum G_j^2\\). The expected value of a \\(\\chi^2\\) random variable is its d.f., \\(k-1\\), and the typical size of any \\(\\chi^2\\) value is be \\((k - 1) / k\\), so for the typical residual should be within 2 \\(\\sqrt{(k - 1) / k}\\). e2_res &lt;- sqrt((o - e)^2 / e) g2_res &lt;- sign(o - e) * sqrt(abs(2 * o * log(o / e))) data.frame(e2_res, g2_res, obs = 1:length(e2_res)) %&gt;% rownames_to_column() %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = e2_res:g2_res) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = obs, y = value, color = name)) + geom_point() + scale_color_mf() Here is a summary of the analysis. data.frame(o, e, e2_res, g2_res) ## o e e2_res g2_res ## tall cut-leaf 926 906.1875 0.6581581 6.328906 ## tall potato-leaf 288 302.0625 0.8091222 -5.240221 ## dwarf cut-leaf 293 302.0625 0.5214343 -4.224967 ## dwarf potato-leaf 104 100.6875 0.3301172 2.594764 You can perform the chi-square test of the Pearson test statistic with chisq.test(). chisq.test(o, p = pi) ## ## Chi-squared test for given probabilities ## ## data: o ## X-squared = 1.4687, df = 3, p-value = 0.6895 "]
