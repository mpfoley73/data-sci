The chi-square goodness-of-fit test, tests whether observed frequency counts \\(O_j\\) of the \\(j \\in k\\) levels of a categorical variable differ from expected frequency counts \\(E_j\\) (\\(H_0\\) is \\(O_j = E_j, \\hspace{5mm} \\forall j \\in k\\). There are two test statistics for this test, \\(X^2\\) and \\(G^2\\). The sampling distribution of each test statistic approach the chi-squared distribution as \\(n\\) becomes large. Calculate both test statistic. If the resulting p-values are close, then you can be confident that the large-sample approximation is working well. The Pearson goodness-of-fit statistic is \\[X^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_j - E_j)^2}{E_j}\\] where \\(O_j = p_j n\\) and \\(E_j = \\pi_j n\\). The deviance statistic is \\[G^2 = 2 \\sum O_j \\log \\left( \\frac{O_j}{E_j} \\right)\\] If the saturated model (the observed data represent the fit of the saturated model, the most complex model possible with the given data) proportions \\(p_j\\) equal equal the expected proportions \\(\\pi_j\\), "]
