# Inference

Categorical data is usually generated from unrestricted sampling (Poisson), fixed sample size sampling (binomial or multinomial)

Poisson sampling assumes the random data generating mechanism can be described by a Poisson distribution. It is useful for modeling events occuring over a fixed period of time or space. It is useful when the event probability is very small and the event count is very large.
